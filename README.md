## Introduction

Understanding gender specific consumer behavior and predicting future sales trends are critical for retail businesses. This project analyzes sales data using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and various machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. The findings aim to optimize marketing strategies and inventory management.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes sales records categorized by gender, age, city, and product category. It provides a comprehensive view of consumer purchasing patterns over a period.

## Machine Learning Models

Several machine learning models are implemented and evaluated in this project:

- **Logistic Regression**: Used for binary classification of purchase behaviors.
- **Naïve Bayes**: A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**: A non-parametric method used for classification by measuring distances to the nearest neighbors.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method for classification, regression, and other tasks that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees.

## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Python installed. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
